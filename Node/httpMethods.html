>> Top 9 HTTP request Methods, every developer should know


These are HTTP request methods you should be familiar with, rephrased for clarity:

1. 𝐆𝐄𝐓: Used to fetch data from a server. It's the go-to method for retrieving data without making any changes.

2. 𝐏𝐎𝐒𝐓: Sends data to a server to create a new resource. Commonly used in scenarios like submitting forms or uploading files.

3. 𝐏𝐔𝐓: Replaces an existing resource entirely. It should be used when you have complete data to update an entity.

4. 𝐃𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐓𝐄: Removes a specified resource from the server. This method is essential for operations where data needs to be permanently erased.

5. 𝐏𝐀𝐓𝐂𝐇: Updates specific parts of a resource. Ideal when you only need to change a few fields rather than replacing the entire resource.

6. 𝐇𝐄𝐀𝐃: Functions similarly to GET but retrieves only the headers, not the full resource. This method is often used to check the status or metadata of a resource before making a full request.

7. 𝐎𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒: Reveals the communication capabilities and supported methods of a server for a specific resource, helping determine possible interactions.

8. 𝐓𝐑𝐀𝐂𝐄: Returns a request as received by the server, useful for debugging purposes by showing any alterations made by intermediate servers.

9. 𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐂𝐓: Converts the connection into a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, typically used to facilitate SSL connections for secure browsing (HTTPS).

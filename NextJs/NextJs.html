                                    QUESTIONS AND SOLUTION
______________________________________________________________________________________________

<!-- Beginner Level -->

1. What is Next.js ?
   - Answer: Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and building hybrid applications. It offers a simpler way to work with React by providing built-in optimizations for performance and SEO.

2. What are the key features of Next.js ?
   - Answer: Key features include:
     - Server-side rendering (SSR)
     - Static site generation (SSG)
     - File-based routing
     - API routes
     - Image optimization
     - Automatic code splitting
     - Built-in CSS and Sass support

3. How does routing work in Next.js ?
   - Answer: Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Each file in the `pages` directory automatically maps to a route. For example, `pages/index.js` maps to `/`, and `pages/about.js` maps to `/about`.

4. What is the difference between `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` in Next.js ?
   - Answer:
     - `getStaticProps`: Fetches data at build time, used for Static Site Generation (SSG).
     - `getServerSideProps`: Fetches data on each request, used for Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

5. What are Next.js API routes ?
   - Answer: API routes allow you to build backend functionality directly in a Next.js app. These routes are placed in the `pages/api` directory and can handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).

6. Explain Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js.
   - Answer: SSG is a Next.js feature where pages are pre-rendered at build time. This means the content is generated ahead of time and served as static HTML files for faster page loads and improved SEO.

<!-- Intermediate Level -->

7. What is `getStaticPaths` and when do you use it ?
   - Answer: `getStaticPaths` is used with `getStaticProps` for dynamic routes. It defines the paths to pre-render at build time for dynamic pages. It helps Next.js to know which dynamic pages to generate during the build process.

8. How can you implement dynamic routing in Next.js ?
   - Answer: Dynamic routing in Next.js is achieved using bracket notation in the `pages` folder. For example, `pages/[id].js` will match `/123`, `/abc`, etc., where `id` is a dynamic parameter.

9. What is Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Next.js ?
   - Answer: ISR allows you to update static content after deployment without rebuilding the entire site. Pages can be re-rendered in the background at a specified interval to refresh the data.

10. What is the role of the `Head` component in Next.js ?
    - Answer: The `Head` component is used to modify the `<head>` of the HTML document. It's useful for setting meta tags, titles, linking to stylesheets, and more for each page.

11. How can you add CSS to a Next.js project ?
    - Answer: Next.js supports several ways to add CSS:
      - Global styles using `styles/global.css`
      - CSS Modules with `import styles from './Component.module.css'`
      - Built-in support for Sass
      - Styled-components or Emotion for CSS-in-JS

12. Explain the concept of `getInitialProps` in Next.js.
    - Answer: `getInitialProps` is a legacy method for data fetching in Next.js pages. It is executed on both server and client-side. However, `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` are preferred now.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

<!-- Advanced Level -->

13. How do you optimize performance in a Next.js application ?
    - Answer: Performance can be optimized using:
      - Lazy loading components with dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`).
      - Image optimization using `next/image`.
      - Using `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` effectively.
      - Code splitting and minification.
      - Enabling Server-Side Caching.

14. What is the `next.config.js` file used for ?
    - Answer: The `next.config.js` file is used to configure Next.js behavior, such as setting up custom Webpack configurations, environment variables, redirects, and rewrites.

15. How can you handle authentication in Next.js ?
    - Answer: Authentication in Next.js can be handled using:
      - API routes for authentication (e.g., JWT tokens, OAuth).
      - Session management libraries like `next-auth`.
      - Server-side logic using `getServerSideProps` for session-based authentication.

16. Explain how to use `next/dynamic` for code splitting.
    - Answer: `next/dynamic` allows you to dynamically import components to split code. For example:
      ```js
      import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
      const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('./components/HeavyComponent'));
      ```
      This ensures that `HeavyComponent` is only loaded when required, reducing the initial bundle size.

17. What are middlewares in Next.js and how are they used ?
    - Answer: Middleware in Next.js allows you to run code before a request is completed, such as authentication or redirects. You can define middleware in the `middleware.js` file.

<!-- Master Level -->

18. How does Next.js handle static and dynamic rendering together ?
    - Answer: Next.js allows static and dynamic rendering within the same application. You can use `getStaticProps` for static pages and `getServerSideProps` for dynamic pages. The application can also use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to update static pages dynamically.

19. How does Next.js handle large-scale applications and serverless deployments ?
    - Answer: Next.js supports serverless functions, which are ideal for scaling large applications. Each API route and page can be deployed as a serverless function. The framework also supports serverless deployment with providers like Vercel.

20. What are some challenges when deploying a Next.js application in production ?
    - Answer:
      - Handling caching effectively for performance.
      - Managing SSR/SSG/ISR and ensuring the right pages are pre-rendered.
      - Ensuring environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev vs production).
      - Debugging SSR issues and working with serverless functions.

21. How do you optimize images in Next.js using the `next/image` component ?
    - Answer: The `next/image` component automatically optimizes images by resizing, serving modern formats (like WebP), and lazy loading images. You can specify image dimensions, quality, and loading strategy.

22. How do you handle custom server configuration in Next.js ?
    - Answer: A custom server in Next.js can be set up by using a Node.js server (e.g., Express or Koa). You would create a custom server file (`server.js`) and handle routing and other logic manually. This is typically done when you need more control over server behavior.

23. What is the importance of environment variables in Next.js and how do you configure them ?
    - Answer: Environment variables in Next.js are important for managing different configurations for development, testing, and production. They are configured in `.env` files, and accessed in code using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.

24. Explain how to handle deployment and scaling for Next.js apps in a cloud environment (e.g., Vercel, AWS, etc.).
    - Answer: Next.js integrates seamlessly with Vercel, where it can automatically optimize and deploy. For other cloud platforms like AWS, you can deploy the app on services like Lambda, S3, or ECS using Docker. Serverless functions and edge caching are key for scaling.

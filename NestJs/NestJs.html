______________________________________________________________________________________________

1. What is NestJS, and what are its main advantages over other Node.js frameworks?

   NestJS is a framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It is built with TypeScript and is heavily inspired by Angular, offering a similar structure with decorators, modules, and dependency injection. Its main advantages include:
   - TypeScript support: Full TypeScript support with type-safety.
   - Modular architecture: Facilitates building scalable and maintainable applications.
   - Built-in features: Offers powerful features like dependency injection, middleware, interceptors, and guards out of the box.
   - Extensibility: Easily integrates with other libraries like TypeORM, Mongoose, GraphQL, etc.
   - Microservices ready: Supports microservices architecture natively.
   - Testing support: Strong support for unit and end-to-end testing.

2. Explain the architecture of a NestJS application.

   A NestJS application follows a modular architecture:
   - Modules: Encapsulate related functionality, typically corresponding to specific features (e.g., UserModule, AuthModule).
   - Controllers: Handle incoming requests and return responses (routes are defined here).
   - Services: Contain the business logic and interact with data sources (e.g., databases).
   - Providers: Any class that can be injected into another class (e.g., services, repositories).
   - Middleware: Functions that run before request handling (e.g., logging, authentication).
   - Pipes: Used for validation, transformation, or sanitization of input data.
   - Interceptors: Modify or extend request handling (e.g., logging, caching).

3. How do you create and use custom decorators in NestJS?

   Custom decorators in NestJS are defined using the `@SetMetadata` function or creating your own decorators via `Reflect.metadata` to attach metadata to classes, methods, or properties. For example:
   ```typescript
   import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

   export const Roles = (...roles: string[]) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);
   ```
   You can then use this decorator in combination with guards to handle authorization logic.

4. Describe how dependency injection works in NestJS.

   NestJS uses constructor-based dependency injection. Providers (like services) are registered in modules and are automatically injected into the constructors of classes that need them. NestJS resolves dependencies at runtime using the module system. 
   - Providers are injected into controllers, services, or other providers through the constructor.
   - The container resolves the dependencies and injects the required instances.

5. How do you implement middleware in a NestJS application ?

   Middleware in NestJS can be implemented by creating a class that implements the `NestMiddleware` interface and using the `@Middleware()` decorator. Middleware is executed before route handlers and can modify the request and response objects.
   Example:
   ```typescript
   import { Injectable, NestMiddleware } from '@nestjs/common';

   @Injectable()
   export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
     use(req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) {
       console.log('Request...', req);
       next();
     }
   }
   ```

6. Explain the use of interceptors in NestJS and provide an example of their use.

   Interceptors in NestJS are used to transform the result of a request before sending the response or to handle additional logic before the request is processed. They can be used for:
   - Logging
   - Caching
   - Transforming responses
   - Handling errors
   Example:
   ```typescript
   import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
   import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
   import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

   @Injectable()
   export class LoggingInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
     intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
       console.log('Before handling the request');
       return next.handle().pipe(
         tap(() => console.log('After handling the request'))
       );
     }
   }
   ```

7. What are guards in NestJS, and how do you use them for authentication and authorization?

   Guards are used to handle authorization logic and can determine whether a request should be processed or not. Guards can be used to protect routes (e.g., check if a user is authenticated).
   Example of an `AuthGuard` using JWT:
   ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
   import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

   @Injectable()
   export class JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {}
   ```

8. Discuss the use of pipes in NestJS for data validation and transformation.

   Pipes are used to validate, transform, or sanitize data coming from the client. You can use built-in pipes like `ValidationPipe` for data validation or create custom pipes for more complex scenarios.
   Example of using a built-in `ValidationPipe`:
   ```typescript
   @Post()
   @UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())
   create(@Body() createDto: CreateDto) {}
   ```

9. How do you implement exception filters in NestJS to handle errors globally?

   Exception filters in NestJS catch errors and handle them globally. You can create a custom exception filter by implementing the `ExceptionFilter` interface.
   Example:
   ```typescript
   import { Catch, ExceptionFilter, ArgumentsHost } from '@nestjs/common';

   @Catch()
   export class AllExceptionsFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
     catch(exception: any, host: ArgumentsHost) {
       const response = host.switchToHttp().getResponse();
       response.status(500).json({
         statusCode: 500,
         message: 'Internal server error',
       });
     }
   }
   ```

10. Explain how to use NestJS with TypeORM or another ORM for database integration.

   NestJS integrates seamlessly with ORMs like TypeORM or Mongoose. To use TypeORM, install the necessary packages and configure a database connection in the `AppModule`:
   ```typescript
   import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
   import { User } from './user.entity';

   @Module({
     imports: [
       TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
         type: 'mysql',
         host: 'localhost',
         port: 3306,
         username: 'test',
         password: 'test',
         database: 'test',
         entities: [User],
         synchronize: true,
       }),
       TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User]),
     ],
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```
